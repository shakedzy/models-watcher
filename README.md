This repo contains a script that scans Hugging Face models repository for new and modified base-models (meaning, models which are not derived fom other models),
and send information summary to a dedicated Telegram group.

Unlike the `huggingface_hub`'s `HfApi` object, which cannot tell apart new from modified models, this script analyzes the information
found on Hugging Face's website (such as the model tree and) to extract additional information about each model, thus deciding if it's
new or modified.
